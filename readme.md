# Rock Paper Scissors

## Overview

This is the first JavaScript project I chose to implement from The Odin Project, primarily for the purpose of fun and practice. It’s a straightforward console-based version of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, demonstrating fundamental JavaScript skills without focusing on UI elements.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Open the browser console (usually accessible via **F12** or **Ctrl + Shift + J**).
3. Follow the console prompts to enter your choice—rock, paper, or scissors.
4. The game will run for **5** rounds and display the final scores, declaring the winner between the human player and the computer.
